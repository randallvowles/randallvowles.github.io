    <p>I am currently employed at <a href="https://global.weathernews.com/">Weathernews America, Inc.</a> as an operational meteorologist, focusing on aviation weather. I graduated from the <a href="https://atmos.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a> in December 2017 with my Bachelor of Science degree in Atmospheric Science and have been employed at Weathernews since January 2018.  
    </p>
    <p>Since discovering and following my passion for all things weather, I have worked in three different areas of meteorology; instrumentation, forecasting, and programming. I helped maintain a local network of weather stations around the Greater Salt Lake Valley region; installing, calibrating, and maintaining all individual weather instruments that comprise each station. As an operational meteorologist I create weather forecasts for airports around the world and provide weather briefings for all conditions. Iâ€™ve used Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS as a tool to check for quality assurance in weather observations and to create graphical visualizations and analyses. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I was employed as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the <a href="http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/mesowest_overview/#">MesoWest Research Group</a>. I provided user support for MesoWest and SynopticLabs services, primarily helping resolve issues with their webpages, API services, and data acquisition. I also wrote articles and guides for the <a href="https://blog.synopticlabs.org/">SynopticLabs Blog</a> and maintained MesoWest's social media presence on the <a href="https://twitter.com/mesowestutah">MesoWest Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mesowest/">MesoWest Facebook</a>. Additionally, I also worked as a technician for their local network of stations across the Salt Lake Valley and over the Great Salt Lake; performing maintenance visits, preparing instruments for deployment in the field, and remotely monitoring each station's status.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a meteorologist with Weathernews, my primary task is creating short-term (6-36 hours) weather forecasts for airports (TAFs). Written and verbal briefings are also provided to support forecasts, answer questions, and explain severe weather events. The customer-requested airports are located around the world, which requires study and familiarity with the local topography and how it interacts with synoptic and mesoscale meteorological events. In order to maintain a high level of knowledge and proficiency, trainings (such as Comet MetEd modules) are completed on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my undergraduate, I was able to learn and use several various programming languages but found Python and JavaScript the two that suited me best. I've used Python to process meteorological observations for quality assurance, run statistical analyses, and produce graphical representations. I've also used JavaScript to create several webpages to display various weather information or help analyze meteorological events. As a side project (and for fun), I have a few Twitterbots that I coded in Python to tweet random and severe weather conditions. The Twitter accounts are no longer active but you can see the code repositories <a href="https://github.com/randallvowles/randomweathernow">here</a> or <a href="https://github.com/randallvowles/severeweathernow">here</a>. I look forward to the opportunity to use and improve these skills in new and exciting ways.
